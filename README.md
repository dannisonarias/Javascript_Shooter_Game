## Game Design Process

I was given five days as the deadline for this game, Here's what those days looked like.

1. I dedicated the first day to reading phaser 3 documentation.
2. Day two - planning out the game objectives, entities, and scenes.
3. Day three - I begin writing the code for the game.
4. Day four - Finishing touches !
5. Day five - Writing Tests for the game.

The 5 days i was given wasn't a suitable enough time to get all the objectives i had planned for the game.
I missed the opportunity to add lives to the ship and also add animations to some of the enemies.

I was however able to get the main objective and functionality of the game finished.

- Game Audios and animations.
- Game difficulty increased by levels.
- Player movement and interaction
- Player Score
- Leader Board using external API to store data.
